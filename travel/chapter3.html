        <h1 class="title">3 Month Recap &ndash; A Taste of South India</h1>
        <h3 class="info"><span class="date">July 22, 2016</span><span class="author">Drew Estes</span></h3>
        <p>It&apos;s been a while since my last post, and anyone trying to follow my travels is mainly doing so through my Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat. The posts here have been more a means to practice writing, but I realize many friends and family members just want a better idea of what I&apos;m doing, how I&apos;m traveling, what the country is like, etc. So this post is mainly dedicated to filling everyone in, as well as providing my impressions of the country. If that&apos;s not the type of post you want to read, you can go ahead and skip this one.</p>
        <p>I spent a fair amount of time preparing myself for the things I might deal with in India, only to find my most pressing questions in the beginning were things such as &ldquo;how the hell do I cross the street here?&rdquo; and &ldquo;why is everyone staring so much?&rdquo; As it turns out, when you&apos;re one of the only (and sometimes <span class="italicized">the</span> only) white people in a city, you tend to stand out. Many children and teens here have never seen a foreigner before.</p>
        <p>There&apos;s a lot to cover, much of which I&apos;m just going to gloss over, so you&apos;re welcome to ask for more details if you&apos;re curious. I divided this post into sections, so you can read the parts you&apos;re most interested in. Apologies for the nearly nonexistent transitions. Without further ado&hellip;</p>
        <h2>Part 1 &ndash; Acommodation</h2>
        <p>So far, I&apos;ve used 4 methods for finding places to stay: Airbnb, hotels/guesthouses, Couchsurfing, and Workaway. Guest houses are like budget homestays. For those unfamiliar with Airbnb/Couchsurfing/Workaway, these are companies that match guests with hosts in different ways. Airbnb works like a hotel, only you stay in someone&apos;s extra room or extra apartment for a cost. Couchsurfing is similar, only it&apos;s free, the arrangements a bit less glamorous, and you typically have more interaction with your host (which is awesome for getting to know a new city or making friends during your travels). Workaway is somewhere in between the two, where instead of direct payment, you work a certain number of hours per week for a family or small business, and in exchange you get a place to stay. I also plan to stay in more youth hostels, as well as potentially an ashram or Buddhist monastery to see what that&apos;s like. (For those who are about to ask, no, I have not seen <span class="i">Eat Pray Love</span>.)</p>
        <h2>Part 2 &ndash; Food</h2>
        <p>I could talk about the food for a long time, but I&apos;ll keep it brief. Indian food is fantastic. A typical breakfast here in the south is idly (small cakes of sticky white rice), served with coconut chutney and sambar (a mildly spicy vegetable soup/sauce, maybe a broth, not sure what exactly to call it). A less healthy (but oh, so delicious) accompaniment is dosa, which is something like a crepe, only thinner and crispier. A masala dosa is a dangerously addicting form of this, served with diced potatoes and some spices inside.</p>
        <p><span class="i">Masala</span>, for those who are only familiar with tikka masala, basically just means a blend of spices. So a masala chai (which is served boiling hot from little stands on literally every street) is a mix of sugar, milk, tea, and some spices like cardamom or cinnamon. Every region seems to have their own style, all of which are delicious. For some chunks of my trip I&apos;ve stayed next to large tea farms, so the tea I drink is often made locally.</p>
        <p>Other honorable mentions for food/dessert include: <span class="b">aloo gobi</span> (potato cauliflower curry), paneer paratha (similar to a quesadilla, and the bread is potato based), sweet paan (mix of a bunch of plants and fruit and spics inside a betel leaf, eaten after meals), faluda (originates in the middle east, seems to have dozens of different styles, usually with custard and saffron), <span class="b">Hyderabadi biryani</span> (a rice dish in the style of Hyderabad, incredibly flavorful, often served with chicken or mutton inside), and the <span class="b">channa masala</span> (chickpea curry) is delicious, and is spicy enough to make the Trader Joe&apos;s version taste like cardboard.</p>
        <h2>Part 3 &ndash; People &amp; Culture</h2>
        <p>In a country of over a billion people, it&apos;s difficult to make accurate generalizations. Okay, &ldquo;accurate generalization&rdquo; is a bit of an oxymoron. I can only describe my experiences in terms of a foreigner, or more specifically, a young white male traveler. All four of these traits affect your experience (often very visibly), so this should be noted.</p>
        <p>For some background, aside from majoring in marketing, I took a range of courses in anthropology, comparative sociology, ethics, communication, international business, psychology, and a number of other liberal arts subjects. Needless to say, people are interesting. Now, for a quick Anthro 101 recap (with apologies to any anthropology majors if I don&apos;t nail these perfectly), we as foreigners entering another society have a tendency to take an ethnocentric view, meaning we view our own cultures as superior because the behaviors we see don&apos;t make sense to us, and so might seem silly or &ldquo;primitive.&rdquo; Enter the idea of Cultural Relativism, which basically amounts to withholding these judgments because all societies have different sets of values, lifestyles, norms, etc., and these differences are not <span class="i">worse</span>, just <span class="i">different</span>.</p>
        <p>This gets more complicated because from an ethical standpoint, you have to draw the line somewhere. Things like slavery, oppression, rape, and violence, for instance, cannot just be ignored as a &ldquo;cultural difference,&rdquo; because enough of the world has agreed that these things are unacceptable (regardless of our progress at putting a stop to them). The tricky part when entering another culture is deciding where certain things fall in terms of morality. Arranged marriages for instance, while on the decline in India, are still common, especially in villages and in more traditional families. Even when one of these young men or women has a choice in who they marry, it is often from a small batch of &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; partners chosen by their parents, i.e. someone from a good family and in the same caste. As an outsider, this instinctively feels wrong to me. And many Indians agree, hence the decline in the practice. But at the same time, data shows that couples in arranged marriages, while comparatively less happy than those in &ldquo;love marriages&rdquo; in the beginning, over time actually learn to appreciate each other more and report <span class="i">more</span> marital satisfaction than those in love marriages.</p>
        <p>Now obviously marital satisfaction doesn&apos;t cancel out the fact that a young man and woman have little to no choice in who they will spend the rest of their lives with. But it draws my attention to how much we value personal freedom in America &ndash; it&apos;s so deeply engrained in our history and our lives that we often take it for granted. In many eastern countries however, decisions center not around the individual, but around the family unit. Families here are much more close-knit, often with multiple generations living under the same roof. Decisions such as marriage affect the whole family and its continuity, and thus become a family decision.</p>
        <p>If the collective choice is against your own wishes but ultimately makes you happier, is it still unethical for your personal choice to be withheld? Aside from the marital satisfaction statistic, often we are less happy when we make a choice for ourselves because we&apos;re aware of all the choices we <span class="i">could</span> have made (like a buyer&apos;s remorse situation). It brings up the age old question, which is more important to you, your freedom or your happiness? Not to go all <span class="i">Brave New World</span> on you, but in many ways we sacrifice personal freedom for collective happiness every day. We obey laws like speed limits and proper waste disposal, and as a result we have fewer people dying or being injured from motor vehicles, and cleaner air and streets. Meanwhile, these two freedoms are not restricted in India, where people drive as fast as traffic will let them, and toss their trash literally anywhere. As a result, many places have large trash piles letting off horrendous smells, which become worse when citizens decide to burn the trash to get rid of it, causing the air to become toxic. Additionally, India is one of the world leaders in traffic accidents, with some statistics saying someone dies in an accident here every 4 minutes.</p>
        <p>A tension grows with each passing month. A new generation of young, educated, and cultured men and women in India grow up speaking English (along with multiple other languages) and learning about many more ideas outside of their normal way of life. As their parents work hard to send them to school so they can get stable jobs as doctors and engineers, the awareness that comes with newfound knowledge creates a myriad of conflicts within many families. These young men and women seek out more fulfilling lives in areas such as art or film or startups, areas completely contrary to their parents&apos; dreams of stable and prestigious careers. The tides are changing as new attitudes about careers, marriage, sex, and even the role of families shift the cultural landscape.</p>
        <p>India is a country of dichotomies &ndash; of different realities that seem so opposite it can be astounding to see them side by side. For instance&hellip;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A brand new sports car pulls up next to an ox cart at an intersection. Sparks fly across the sidewalk and into the street as men without gloves or eye protection weld together metal beams. They&apos;re constructing an enormous five star hotel next to an assemblage of small homes, each constructed from tarps, sticks, and plastic sheets.</li>
            <li>Small shops sit in the middle of the sidewalk, forcing pedestrians to walk into the road, where cars ignore the painted lines (if they exist at all) and often drive at full speed in the opposite direction as traffic.</li>
            <li>You ask for directions from a smiling pedestrian who happily obliges, only you realize after asking someone else that the first person had no idea, and in all likelihood just didn&apos;t want to upset you by saying they didn&apos;t know.</li>
            <li>A sweet old lady hosts you for dinner, and is exceedingly generous. Or so it seems, until you hear her berating her servants to tears when you&apos;re out of sight. Later, you get into a seemingly hostile negotiation with a rickshaw driver as he tries to gouge you over the price of the ride, only to find yourself in friendly conversation with him as soon as you step into the vehicle, as though nothing ever happened.</li>
            <li>You buy a beer at a restaurant that isn&apos;t technically allowed to serve it by law, but they can because they pay annual bribes for the local police to turn the other way.</li>
            <li>And of course, cows, goats, monkeys, and who knows how many other animals roam the streets and roadsides as they please. If a cow decides to take a nap in the middle of the street, drivers just have to deal with it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="italicized">&ldquo;What Does the Wobble Mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p>As time goes on and I go long stretches between speaking to others who are fluent in English, I&apos;ve come to appreciate those moments much more. It seems other travelers do too, because it becomes very easy to see another foreigner on the street, strike up a conversation, and two minutes later be sitting down to grab a meal together, or team up on some adventure. Even without the language barrier, a day of conversations here can be tiring (especially in the beginning). Between decoding the thick Indian accent, or simply trying to account for the differences in communication styles between countries (such as a certain word or phrase having a completely different meaning), it requires a bit more brainpower than your typical conversation. That being said, the challenge is often exhilarating, and a great way to view our own norms through a new lens.</p>
        <p>Clearly, communication has been an area of constant fascination for me. Aside from trying to master the nuances of the famous &ldquo;Indian head wobble,&rdquo; learning how to effectively communicate with people from different cultures can be a challenge. Using the head wobble as an example, I&apos;ll explain this as best i can. It&apos;s a side to side wobbling of the head, with the axis of the turn usually centering around the nose. While a similar gesture in the U.S. might indicate uncertainty or resistance (like how you respond to someone asking if you want to have pho for dinner, when you&apos;d rather have a burrito), in India it&apos;s a bit more complicated. While I&apos;ve heard it explained as &ldquo;sometimes yes, sometimes no, sometimes both, sometimes neither,&rdquo; I think this joke only gets at the surface of it. Most often I&apos;ve found it to work as a simple yes, but just as often it simply means &ldquo;I&apos;m listening&rdquo; or &ldquo;I understand what you&apos;re asking, but this gesture has nothing to do with whether I can help you or not.&rdquo; Context is everything when figuring out what someone&apos;s response actually means.</p>
        <p>Enter the idea of relationship delicacy. The way you&apos;re treated depends very heavily on your relationship with the person in question. If you&apos;re a foreigner, as a guest in their country, many Indians will be very accommodating and go out of their way to ensure your comfort and happiness. Waiters will sometimes pull out chairs for me at many sit-down restaurants (or move tables from booths so I can sit more easily), but not for my Indian friends joining me. They will stand attentively nearby to ensure I&apos;m satisfied with my meal, and will jump to help me if I need anything. However, in low-risk situations where the relationship doesn&apos;t matter as much (such as simple transactions at shops), they can afford to be more direct, such as denying a request or getting impatient with the language barrier and yelling.</p>
        <h2>Part 4 &ndash; &ldquo;Where Should I Go Tomorrow&hellip;?&rdquo; (Route)</h2>
        <p>So far I&apos;ve only been in the southern half of the country, namely the states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Andra Pradesh, and Telengana. I&apos;ve been taking public buses between most cities, and occasionally sleeper trains for longer journeys, which generally only cost around $10 for an air conditioned cabin during a 12 hour journey. Within cities, I initially took rickshaws everywhere, but now that I&apos;ve adjusted to the bus system, I&apos;ve been doing that whenever possible, and occasionally Uber/Ola in major cities, which are somehow cheaper than the tiny rickshaws. I also hitchhiked quite a few times between Auroville and Pondicherry just for kicks. Anyway, here&apos;s the general outline of my route so far:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span class="b">Chennai</span> &ndash; The capital of Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state. I spent about a week here mainly getting adjusted to the country (and the jet lag), with the help of my awesome host Aarushi. This week was pretty well covered in my first post.</li>
            <li><span class="b">Pondicherry/Auroville</span> &ndash; Former French colony on the coast, south of Chennai. You may recognize the name as being the hometown of Pi in &ldquo;The Life of Pi.&rdquo; Parts of the movie were filmed here, and I was able to visit some of the locations during my week in the area.<br />
            Located at the edges of Pondicherry, Auroville is the small international town I wrote about in Chapter 2. I stayed at a guest house (in this case, a hut on a beach), which was roughly midway between the two cities. Here I also became friends with my guest house neighbor Krister, a retired Finnish sculptor living in Sweden.</li>
            <li><span class="b">Tiruvannamalai</span> &ndash; Small city inland from Pondicherry, known for the Sri Ramana ashram. Sri Ramana was a widely respected guru who is known for spending years at a time up in the small mountain next to the city, deep in meditation. While walking to see the ashram during my first evening there I met Moritz, a friendly German traveler my age. The next morning we hiked the peak of the mountain (along with a Tamil guy whose English was very limited), and had some great conversations along the way. Upon our arrival at the top, we rested on the ashy rocks in the heat of the midday sun, next to an old naked yogi with dreadlocks who, after putting on some clothes, gave each of us a blessing.</li>
            <li><span class="b">Bangalore</span> &ndash; I booked an Airbnb here in the neighborhood of Jayanagar, which is pretty far from most things to do in Bangalore. Combined with the nearly motionless traffic, it was difficult to see as much of the city without wasting most of the day in a bus or cab. I explored one of the many large botanical gardens, and later in the week went to some bars and house parties with people I met there. Bangalore is a major commercial city that pulls Indians from around the country to come work there, which has made it a very diverse city domestically. While Hindi and English are the national languages of India, a large portion of the country speaks neither of them. There are well over 1,600 languages spoken in India, 22 of them official state languages. In Bangalore, I found a group where between fifteen university students, they spoke 18 languages.</li>
            <li><span class="b">Madurai</span> &ndash; Due to some poor timing with transportation I only stayed in Madurai just over a day, which also happened to be the day of the Indian presidential election, so almost nothing was open. I did however, manage to visit the Meenakshi temple, an enormous structure composed of large walls and high Dravidian towers, with a series of hallways, tunnels, and courtyards within. Carvings of various deities decorated the countless stone pillars that supported the ceiling above, a magnificent spectrum of colors and patterns. I had my first Couchsurfing experience in Madurai, where I stayed with Karthik, who was extremely helpful as I plotted out my adventures around the city.</li>
            <li><span class="b">Kodaikanal</span> &ndash; I spent three weeks in Kodaikanal doing a Workaway arrangement, where I provided basic consulting to a small local business. Kodaikanal is one of the many hill stations of India, typically small towns where British colonials could go to escape during the oppressive heat of the Indian summers (kind of ironic, seeing how the British were usually the ones doing the oppressing). The temperature was much more moderate than the lowlands and coasts of India, and the weather much more similar to Seattle (aside from the insane difference in UV index). I spent much of my time with my roommate/coworker Jonathan, a student my age from Paris. Though we had both initially planned to stay a month or two, I ended up deciding to continue traveling after a few weeks (and him shortly after).</li>
            <li><span class="b">Coimbatore</span> &ndash; Descending from the hills, I stopped for a few days in the heat I had grown to miss. There wasn&apos;t a lot to see here, but I checked out the old Forestry Museum at a local college, which included many peculiar items (in layman&apos;s terms, there was lots of weird shit). Adding to my ever-growing list of &ldquo;things I&apos;ve seen in life that I never thought I would see,&rdquo; at this museum I saw an elephant fetus in a large container. It was 14 months into development and about the size of a medium-sized dog. The museum also had a great deal of early taxidermy attempts with an amusingly inconsistent labeling system. Next to the beetle collection with conventional scientific names like &ldquo;prionomma atratum,&rdquo; stood a monkey with glass eyes, arranged haphazardly on a small branch with a label that simply said &ldquo;mischievous monkey.&rdquo;</li>
            <li><span class="b">Ooty</span> &ndash; Another hill station, arguably a bit nicer than Kodaikanal (and cleaner), I stayed here for a couple nights on my way to Wayanad, a district known for its wildlife sanctuary. Ooty has a large botanical garden, and as I have found myself seeking out these gardens in nearly every city I go to, I spent a couple hours wandering around it, and dodging hordes of teenagers incessantly trying to get &ldquo;just one selfie&rdquo; with me (which always becomes more as soon as you say yes to one).</li>
            <li><span class="b">Wayanad (Kalpetta)</span> &ndash; I came to Wayanad for a single reason: I wanted to see some wild elephants. For all the hassle it turned out to be, I&apos;m glad to say this mission was successful. In Wayanad I had my first negative experience with a host I had booked through Airbnb, where every single thing about his listing was false (&ldquo;apartment&rdquo; turned out to be a small homestay deep in the rainforest, 10km outside of the city he claimed it was in, and the &ldquo;free wifi&rdquo; and &ldquo;free breakfast&rdquo; were neither free, nor even available at all in the case of the wifi). The area was incredible though, and to top it all off, on the bus leaving the state I saw a Bengal tiger run across the road, which is apparently uncommon to see even for here.</li>
            <li><span class="b">Mysore</span> &ndash; I stayed in Mysore for only 4 nights, though I definitely plan to go back. I had my second Couchsurfing experience here, where I stayed with Satwik and another Couchsurfer Bianca, from Germany. Both were awesome people and the three of us hung out quite a bit for those few days. My first night in Mysore, Bianca and I went to the Muslim Bazaar, the market where the famous Mysore Soap is created, along with oils and handrolled incense. The next day I took a tour of the royal palace, which was closing the following day because of the royal wedding taking place there the following day. The palace was especially interesting with all the setup for the wedding going on inside. It felt a bit like a cross between the palace of Versaille and something from Candyland, due to the incredible amount of colors incorporated into the extravagant architecture, blending styles of British and Wodeyar architects.</li>
            <li><span class="b">Hampi</span> &ndash; My train arrived in Hampi on a Saturday morning, and I planned on staying a few days before moving on. Before I even found a place to stay though, I fell in love with the place. I ended up staying in a guest house there for nearly three weeks. Hampi is unique in many ways, and brings a never ending flow of international travelers, even during the off season. Formerly the most populated city in the region, and home to numerous dynasties and empires, it now supports just a few thousand people, if that. Ruins of ancient bridges, aqueducts palaces and temples are scattered across the landscape at nearly every turn. Surrounding the wide expanses of rice fields, cliffs and boulders serve to support an ever growing subculture of rock climbers. Open roads wind along the valleys and rivers in all directions, providing the perfect place to cruise along on a motorbike and enjoy the views. The weather is mild enough to go for long runs in the morning, (with stops along the way of course, to drink from a coconut fresh from the tree), and the guest houses have communal dining areas that serve as the perfect place to lounge around or to meet fellow travelers. I spent my time here doing all these things, as well as writing a fair amount. I met a ton of amazing people from around the world: some were locals or Indian tourists (Manju, Thimma, Mani, Mowgli, Huda, Kitti, and Nikhil) others German, Argentinian, Norwegian, or Australian (shoutouts to Patrice, Melisa, Erik, and Smiley, respectively). My last few days I even joined a merry band of 22 Irish students, who were loads of fun as well.<br />
            One day some friends and I climbed a rock overlooking the Hampi landscape, and I decided to practice some scene writing, so for anyone who enjoys that kind of thing:</li>
            <blockquote class="top-margin">I feel the granite press against my back as I lay down atop one of the many boulders peppering the landscape. In the distance, past the rice fields and palm trees, rests an ancient temple of the Vijayanagar empire. A man climbs the stone steps to the top and lights a beacon, visible across the lush valley. On the opposite side of the winding river, we watch the sunset illuminate the western face of the temple. &ldquo;We,&rdquo; in this instance, being a gang of langur monkeys alongside a dozen human monkeys. Climbers, travelers and small fuzzy creatures, we gather amongst the boulders, sharing oddly similar relationships with the stone. Amidst a chorus of chirping crickets, a holy chant from the priests echoes from the temple and against the stone behind us.<br />The clouds make a slow journey through the pink and violet sky, revealing a waning sliver of the moon. I turn my gaze to Jupiter and Mars directly above, the red and white points in the sky framed perfectly in an oblong clearing on the clouds. My mind settles into a mellow reflection. The ruins of a fallen empire serve as a gentle reminder just how unpredictable our futures can be, and like so many others gazing into so many versions of the same sky, I imagine how the cosmos above could hold a place in mine.</blockquote>
            <li><span class="b">Hyderabad</span> &ndash; I write this now in my last few days in Hyderabad before leaving to Mumbai (aka Bombay). I explored some of the sites and met up with Jonathan again, as he had traveled to Hampi and stayed for about a week. We climbed the steps of the Birla Mandir, a large white marble temple overlooking the city, unlike any I had seen so far. As the sun set, hundreds of eagles circled the sky overhead, some filling the otherwise empty trees beside the temple. The chanting from the priests of the temple soon blended with the Muslim prayer (Maghrib) as it echoed across the city. In the next couple of days, my friend Sahith from UW put me in touch with his friend Rakesh who lives here, who was kind enough to spend an entire day showing me around the city, and introducing me to some of the best tasting food I&apos;ve had in recent memory.
            Hyderabad, among all cities I&apos;ve been to so far, has the most obvious history of alternating Hindu and Muslim rulership. India has been conquered and reconquered by more empires and dynasties than I can count over its immense history, one of the most famous being the religious being the repeated establishment and elimination of Islamic powers from the regions. Now that the country exists in a comparatively peaceful manner, both populations make up significant portions of the city. Muslims live predominantly in an area referred to as Old Hyderabad, where you can walk through the streets and clearly see the architectural influences, as well as the different styles of the people (women in burkas and men in throbes and taqiyahs).</li>

        <p><span class="bold underline">Bonus Section</span></p>
        <h2>Top 3 Most Common Questions Asked by Indians to Foreigners</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>&ldquo;What is your country?&rdquo; (alternatively: &ldquo;Coming from?&rdquo;) &ndash; Almost everyone wants to know where you&apos;re from. I get asked this question 20-30 times a day.</li>
            <li>&ldquo;What is your good name?&rdquo; &ndash; This is the direct translation from the Hindi phrase (and other regional languages), which have different ways of asking someone&apos;s name depending on the formality (this version being the most formal/respectful).</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Hello, my friend!&rdquo; &ndash; Not a question, but said by tons of people on the street to get your attention. Often seemingly innocuous at first, it&apos;s only a matter of time before you figure out what they&apos;re trying to sell you. Today I had three people on the same sidewalk do this in only a few minutes. Each told me I had something in my ear, went to grab it by trying to stick their fingers in my ear and doing what was some attempt at a magic trick. Turns out all three of them (and others on that sidewalk) are amateur street magicians, and each asked for a donation after attempting to violate my ear canal. This wasn&apos;t the normal &ldquo;look it&apos;s a coin&rdquo; trick, but a ball of orange wax whose cleanliness I have serious doubts about.</li>
            <li>&ldquo;Selfie?&rdquo; &ndash; in many areas, white people are rare enough to be a bit of a spectacle, particularly among young working class men between 15 and 30, with minimal English. These guys will often run up, smiling and holding up their phones as they ask to take a selfie. Sometimes they won&apos;t ask at all, and will simply come up next to you with a phone out and start posing. As soon as you say yes to one person and &ldquo;just one selfie,&rdquo; dozens of their friends come running over to get their own personal photo with you.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&ndash;&ndash;</p>
        <p>Well that&apos;s enough for this update. If anyone has any questions, you&apos;re welcome to send them my way. I feel like there are an endless number of misunderstandings and incorrect ideas by Westerners about India, so I would be happy to clarify anything to the best of my knowledge. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll look back on this post months from now and reconsider some of the observations I make now, and what they mean, but it&apos;s a neverending process of trying to be less wrong.</p>
        <p>Until next time,</p>
        <p>Drew</p>
