                        <p>Imagine yourself as a small child. The world is new and awesome and confusing. One day, you see an animal for the first time: it walks on four legs, it&apos;s fluffy, and has big ears. This is a dog, your parents tell you. Later, you see another fluffy, four-legged creature with big ears, and assume it too is a dog. When your parents explain this new animal is a cat, you adjust your mental framework of the world.</p><p><a href="articles/the-power-of-questions.html">Read more...</a></p>

The urge to move. To explore. To discover. To break out of your routine and remind yourself how to experience the world. To indulge these feelings in spite of every clich&egrave; surrounding them.</p>

                        <p>I scroll past the barrage of profile pictures with French flag filters. Others label it as latest way to pretend you&apos;re helping a cause. Still others argue for the importance of showing solidarity against ISIS. Ultimately though, someone asks: why so much attention on France? Why do we largely ignore the recent travesties in Syria, Afghanistan, Kenya, Yemen, Lebanon, or so many other places? Why does Facebook create a filter for the attacks on France, but not anyone else?</p>

                        <p>William Ury took a seat, eager to get started. Across from him sat Hugo Chavez, president of Venezuela. Chavez had kept Ury waiting the last few hours, testing his patience, and Ury dove right into his recommendations. Chavez was facing demands for his resignation, and had called Ury (a negotiations expert from the U.S.) in for help. After hearing the initial suggestion however, Chavez was not impressed. He stood up in anger and yelled at Ury, who clearly didn&apos;t know what he was talking about and had no idea how to run a country.</p>
