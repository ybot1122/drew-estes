                    <h2>So what's this site all about?</h2>
                    <p>Things are always changing here, but we have two main sections. The &ldquo;Articles&rdquo; section uses a lens of personal growth to share lessons in communication, leadership, effective thinking, and creative expression. We draw on a wide range of subjects for this, from arts and humanities to science and technology.</p>

                    <h2>Those are some nice buzzwords, but what does all that even mean?</h2>
                    <p>Let&apos;s try the Dictionary Approach. The word &ldquo;decide&rdquo; comes from latin roots meaning &ldquo;to cut off&rdquo; or &ldquo;to cut away,&rdquo; and it really comes down to this. We want to empower you to make better decisions. This means cutting away the distractions and focusing on what matters to you, to achieve success however you choose to define it. At the same time, if the ideas we share can help build a rational, responsible, and more tolerant global community, we think that&apos;s pretty cool too.</p>

                    <h2>Examples, please?</h2>
                    <p>Consider your daily media consumption. Whether you like articles, videos, social networks, podcasts, games, or any combination of these, every day is a relentless barrage of information fighting for your attention. How do you learn to ignore the fluff and misinformation and find the ideas worth listening to?</p>

                    <p>Or let&apos;s say you&apos;re frustrated by how often smartphones turn people into zombies. You&apos;re talking in a group, someone pulls out their phone, and within seconds the domino effect has everyone looking at their screens. The conversation is derailed. We&apos;ve all seen how new technologies can transform our old habits and social standards, but at the same time technology can greatly improve our lives. So how do we adapt to these changes in a healthy way? How do we continue to form meaningful relationships with the people around us? Articles discuss issues like these.</p>

                    <h2>Okay, so you mentioned there's a second section?</h2>
                    <p>Yep. The "Travel" section, believe it or not, focuses on travel. Curiosity is the foundation of QuackRabbit, and travel is a huge part of that. There&apos;s inevitably some crossover between the two sections, but the Travel section is for short stories, travel tips, images, and a random assortment of whatever we decide should go there. Whether you want a taste of somewhere new, or simply the preparation and inspiration to explore the world, this is for you.</p>
