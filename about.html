                    <h2>Who&apos;s behind all this?</h2>
                    <p>The site started as a collaboration between Toby, who focuses mainly on the development end, and Drew (me) who does the writing and editing. I say editing for two reasons. Firstly, it&apos;s the nightmarish ordeal that makes up 95% of writing time. Secondly, it means the curation and review of other posts, as we&apos;re now in the process of bringing on more writers, such as Lizzie (who we sometimes call Zoe). For more info on the team and getting involved, check The Team section.</p>

                    <h2>So what's the site all about?</h2>
                    <p>You should hear me stumble through an explanation when people ask me this in person. On a good day I can put a nice little box around what this site is all about, only to realize afterward that not everything fits.</p>
                    <p>In short, I don&apos;t really plan articles. I try to, but then I get distracted by a cool idea or question. Then I chase that idea or question down the rabbit hole of the Internet until it turns into an article. So it&apos;s difficult to predict, but generally speaking, these subjects seem pretty consistent:</p>

                    <p>Decisions are hard. People are irrational. The world is complicated. Let&apos;s do something about it.</p>

                    <h2>Okay&hellip; so there's a Travel section too?</h2>
                    <p>Yep. The "Travel" section, believe it or not, focuses on travel. Discover new places, follow your curiosity, and learn about the world. Travel ties deeply into the mentality of QuackRabbit (Toby and I have been operating with a 12.5 hour difference in time zones since April 2016).</p>
                    <p>This section is for short stories, travel tips, photos, and an assortment of whatever else we decide fits into &ldquo;Travel.&rdquo; It will also be the first section to welcome new writers. Whether you want the preparation and inspiration to explore the world, or simply a taste of somewhere new from the comfort of your own home, this is for you.</p>

                    <p>Join our mailing list! We will send you each article as soon as it comes out. Scroll to the bottom of the homepage and you&apos;ll see the big &ldquo;Subscribe&rdquo; box. Emails will have new articles, and maybe an occasional important update. No spam &ndash; only things you care about.</p>
