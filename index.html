                        <p>We classify the world around us and the people in it with an ever-increasing number of dimensions. Tall to short, honest to dishonest, harmless to dangerous, and so on. The ability to notice and act on subtle differences like this is a skill you can develop like any other. Cognitive Complexity, as psychologists call it, is a measurement of this skill , and like most terms in social sciences, the name makes it sound more complicated than it is. You can think of it from two angles: differentiation and integration.

    Differentiation refers to our ability to categorize something using many dimensions rather than just a few. It's the number of mental models or angles we use to understand the world. Let's say you read a story, and you form an opinion of the antagonist, who we'll call Chad. If your only dimension for forming opinions is "bad or good," you might label Chad as evil. Someone could then say you show a low level of cognitive complexity in this area. Meanwhile, someone with more developed differentiation would not describe Chad as evil. Instead, they would consider the less obvious angles, and might decide Chad is misunderstood. Maybe he has underdeveloped empathy, or has high levels of ambition and cynicism as a result of many other unknown factors.</p>
