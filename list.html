        <p>Imagine yourself as a small child. The world is new and awesome and confusing. One day, you see an animal for the first time: it walks on four legs, it&apos;s fluffy, and has big ears. This is a dog, your parents tell you. Later, you see another fluffy, four-legged creature with big ears, and assume it too is a dog. When your parents explain this new animal is a cat, you adjust your mental framework of the world. You begin to notice the less obvious differences between a dog and a cat, compared to those between a dog and a human. As you grow older, you refine these mental frameworks to account for the more subtle differences between things. When before you looked for the visible differences between dogs and cats, now it becomes more nuanced, such as learning to differentiate between a genuinely friendly person and someone with ulterior motives.</p>
        <p>We classify the world around us and the people in it with an ever-increasing number of dimensions. Tall to short, honest to dishonest, harmless to dangerous, and so on. The ability to notice and act on subtle differences like this is a skill you can develop like any other. Cognitive Complexity, as psychologists call it, is a measurement of this skill , and like most terms in social sciences, the name makes it sound more complicated than it is. You can think of it from two angles: differentiation and integration.</p>
