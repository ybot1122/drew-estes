<p>Sit down, America. You’re sitting already? Okay good. It’s time we pull our heads out of our collective asses.</p>
<p>Yeah, we did it. Donald Trump is now the president of the United States. And he has put together one of the least educated administrations in modern history. Whether you’re a woman, a minority, an immigrant, or really anything but an upper class straight white male, you already know you have cause for concern. No, I take that back - if you also happen to fall in the category of “living on a planet affected by climate change,” you should also be worried.</p>
<p>Two things are apparent now:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is no longer “business as usual.” There are now very real threats to our safety and civil liberties - not just those of Americans, but of people around the world.</li>
<li>To prevent these problems, we the people need to change. We need to hold our government to higher standards. We need to get involved. We need to remind ourselves that as citizens of the free world, it is our duty to help shape its future.</li>
<li>We saw in events like the Women’s March that people are passionate. That people care. Most importantly, we saw that we are not alone. The protest successfully set the tone for the coming months, but it’s only the beginning. So pat yourself on the back and keep working.</li>
</ol>
<h2>A Turning Point and a Decision</h2>
<p>With Trump’s election, and similar movements around the globe (not just with the U.K., but in France, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands for instance), the politicians who find increasing support are those who emphasize order, control, and stability, coupled with nationalistic and xenophobic overtones.</p>
<p>These administrations rise when people feel silenced and afraid. When they don’t know who to trust. The leaders claim to be champions for the voiceless, and are willing to sacrifice things like individual rights, international relations, or even the truth itself to meet their goals.</p>
<p>This is not a new occurrence. Movements behind Brexit or Trump highlight a human tendency: when we feel silenced and powerless, we feel our only option is to introduce a little chaos. To invoke change. To lash out in the dark and do something impactful, even if we don’t fully understand what the end result will be.</p>
<p>And we can’t overcome this if we don’t listen to the people we disagree with. The people who until now were ignored.</p>
<p>We on the left-leaning side of the political spectrum nurtured an inflated sense of self-righteousness as Trump gained support. The seemingly sorry state of the Republican party let us confirm once and for all that we indeed fight the Good Fight. All the while, we lost touch with half of the population. Even now, we come to the conclusion that this other half must be composed of racist, xenophobic bigots - that all these people voted for Trump because of these qualities, rather than in spite of them.</p>
<p>As though our views are entirely black and white. As though there is no spectrum. As though the vocal extremes represent everyone who votes Republican.</p>
<p>And now we must ask: how can we rise from this better than before? How can we use this speed bump as an opportunity to foster national involvement and a bipartisan effort for progress?</p>
<h2>Chomsky’s Advice for Creating Change</h2>
<img src="images/articles/how-to-behave-in-trump-america/chomsky.png" />
<div class="caption">Chomsky lecturing. Source</div>
<p>I recently picked up Noam Chomsky's book "Profits Before People," to gain some perspective on U.S. government and business in the wake of the shitshow that is American politics. Chomsky is, among other things, known for his political activism. While called "arguably the most important intellectual alive today" by the New York Times, he holds many controversial stances, and receives plenty of criticism.</p>
<p>Regardless, he has strong opinions and voices them. He provokes new conversations about important issues, and even those who disagree with him feel compelled to participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>I reached out to Mr. Chomsky, expressing concern how our cynicism about politics and our love for distractions and consumption impedes our engagement as citizens. We're not exactly living Brave New World here, but we still have cause for concern. In his response, he said:</p>
<blockquote>“Throughout history, independent critical minds have had to combat these tendencies, using the only techniques available: rational argument, organization, and any other means available – in free societies like ours, quite a range.”</blockquote>
<p>With modern technology and media, we have the tools to spread ideas and organize groups more easily than ever. But in a society like this, we can just as easily become apathetic: consumers rather than citizens. We become isolated in the worlds we craft for ourselves, and disengage with everything else until we feel powerless to change the things we allowed to happen in our negligence.</p>
<p>But this is exactly the wrong approach. Chomsky describes this cynical mindset as a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy:</p>
<blockquote>“If you act like there is no possibility of change for the better, you guarantee that there will be no change for the better.”</blockquote>
<p>As a single citizen, this may seem an insurmountable task. We live in a political system whose leaders can thrive on our apathy and cynicism. But we can organize and work within communities where each member's efforts can combine to create a major impact.</p>
<p>And change is much more possible than you might think. Let’s break it up into 3 general steps:</p>
<h2>1. Accept Responsibility (If You Can Read This, it Applies to You)</h2>
<p>Americans will find this article most relevant right now, though a growing number of readers come from different countries outside the U.S. Either way, most people reading are either from privileged countries or from privileged backgrounds within their countries. You can read and write, you have internet access, and you have enough leisure time to read articles like this. You have a network of people you can share your ideas with, and the ability to research anything you don’t know enough about. Chomsky addresses us specifically:</p>
<blockquote>“For a privileged minority, Western democracy provides the leisure, the facilities, and the training to seek the truth lying hidden behind the veil of distortion and misrepresentation, ideology and class interest, through which the events of current history are presented to us.” - Chomsky</blockquote>
<p>Point being, with privilege comes the ability to influence the world. If we claim to care about what we become as a nation and as a species, we must take responsibility for the things we have the means to change.</p>
<p>If your vision for the future differs from the current path, do something about it. If you have a problem with the system, don't wait for the next election cycle to make your voice heard. As the old saying goes, evil prevails when good people do nothing (or as Uncle Ben says, with great power comes great responsibility).</p>
<p>This is not to say you have to quit your job and become a full-time activist, or anything so dramatic.</p>
<p>But at least be a citizen. Engage with the society you live in. Show it’s cool to care and take action. Start conversations, seek out opposing views and make an honest effort to understand why someone would have them.</p>
<p>Consider learning about your city and state politics - that's where real change happens. States exist to take the lead socially and economically, to try things on a small level and set an example for the rest of the country. If you care about an issue, reach out to your Congressmen (phone calls and handwritten letters work better than Tweets and emails, as former congressional staff member Emily Ellsworth explains).</p>
<p>Better yet, take an easier step every day and vote with your actions. We sometimes fall into the mindset that our only vote is with our ballot, and then we must accept every decision our leaders make until we can pick someone else. But we vote constantly. When we choose to drive our car or fill up on gas, it’s a vote for the automotive and oil industries. When we seek out high quality news sources, practice skepticism, or refrain from sharing things without analysis, it’s a vote against Fake News and Bad Science. These actions add up and make a difference, even if you don’t feel the direct impact of it.</p>
<p>Of course not every cause will feel like your cause. But you care about something. Something frustrates you or scares you enough you wish you could change it. So don't wait around for someone else to decide for you.</p>
<h2>2. Take Initiative (The Myth of “They”)</h2>
<p>Once there was a guy named David. David and his friends wanted to have a picnic, so they picked a day with nice weather and agreed to meet up at the park. During the last picnic they had, they didn’t bring enough food and ended up a little hungry. David felt comfortable the group had learned its lesson and it would work out better this time.</p>
<p>After a jolly old time playing frisbee and enjoying the fresh air, they found a spot in the grass to eat. A few minutes passed before they looked around at each other, each with a dumb smile on their face.</p>
<p>“So... who brought the food?” David asked.</p>
<p>The group pointed fingers at each other with remarks of “I thought you were bringing it” and “it’s not my fault!”</p>
<p>They continued to argue for some time. Some of them even blamed David. After a while the whole group starved and died. The end.</p>
<p>This is, in a sense, humanity. We’re smart as individuals, but effectively stupid as a group. Initiative and organization don’t always come naturally. The larger the group gets, the more responsibility feels divided, and we underestimate the value of our contributions. We assume someone else will take care of any problems that arise until we have no other choice but to face them ourselves.</p>
<p>Sure, we all want to live in peaceful utopia where every day is a picnic and we do what we want. But to build a better society, we need to be the type of people who identify problems and address them. If only one person at David’s picnic stepped up and asked the group to each bring one small dish to the picnic, this ridiculous hypothetical scenario could be avoided with minimal effort from everyone.</p>
<p>Attitudes of apathy and disengagement have seeped into the national mindset. We look at things like climate change and think to ourselves "smart people are working on it, they’ll figure it out." We go about our lives with our heads down, we pay some bills, and push through to the weekend when we can wash it all away with booze and dancing and pizza and the latest season of That Really Good Show All Your Friends Are Talking About.</p>
<p>This is why the world needs more leaders. Not politicians, but leaders. People who, in their cities or neighborhoods or communities, will see a problem and ask how they can solve it, rather than assuming someone else will. People who can admit when a problem is too big for them and will find people who can help, rather than let it discourage them from trying. People who not only step up, but who follow through.</p>
<h2>3. Stay Committed (Just Keep Swimming)</h2>
<img src="images/articles/how-to-behave-in-trump-america/swimming.png" />
<p>Consider the movement of fish in the ocean. They all seem to move together in one direction. However, there are constantly agitators - small groups that swim against the flow. They create conflict and tension and uncertainty for the rest of school. Typically, the small groups readjust and rejoin the group.</p>
<p>But sometimes, when enough of these fish commit to this new direction, the rest of school will turn with them almost instantly. You might expect this number to be a vast majority, but it often only takes a small fraction to change the group direction, as a study at Princeton University found. Similarly, it takes the efforts of a committed minority to create lasting change in society. The movement grows and more people turn.</p>
<p>But to stay committed, we must also understand “Resistance Fatigue,” or the way in which we tire from continued protests and various forms of resistance. Our attention begins to shift elsewhere. We no longer feel we have the energy to stay alert about the issues that matter to us, let alone push back against them. To deal with this, take care of yourself: take a rest to avoid burnout, but explore new ways for your ideas to reach the majority and thrive.</p>
<p>Sometimes this means changing your strategy. Avoid the trap of thinking you’re doing good because everyone around you agrees with you. It means you’re so caught up in using your voice that you don’t realize you’re yelling in an echo chamber and the people you want to convince are not listening (in the blue bubble of Seattle, we do this often). So when you have the good fortune to catch the attention of someone who challenges you, represent your opinions well. Don’t alienate the person by acting stubborn or hostile toward them or their ideas. This is how you lose credibility, and that’s when people stop listening to a movement.</p>
<p>If you’re socially liberal and using words like “intersectionality” when you discuss issues with social conservatives, you probably won’t see much progress with them. The deeper you study something (like social justice), the more nuanced your understanding of it is, and therefore it will take more effort to communicate your understanding of it to a layperson.</p>
<p>The typical rural conservative has little incentive to learn more than the basics of your view. Their concerns fall elsewhere, like finding a stable, full-time job to put food on the table and live more comfortably. “I fully understand why transgender bathrooms are important,”  Joan C. Williams of Harvard Business Review writes, “but I also understand why progressives’ obsession with prioritizing cultural issues infuriates many Americans whose chief concerns are economic.” Or as Bill Scher of Politico writes in “6 Ways Not to Resist Donald Trump”: “yeah, try to bring everybody along. But don’t expect to connect with Trump voters by quoting Foucault and abstract feminist theory.”</p>
<p>Most importantly, remember that change only happens when you commit to it, even if committing means adapting.</p>
<h2>Conclusion (TL;DR)</h2>
<p>If you’re upset at the state of the world, I get it. We’re going through a rough patch. If you feel a bit cynical about the masses right now, dismissing them as idiots and terrible people will only serve to feed your ego and make you feel better about yourself. If you truly care, reach out. Understand them, find the value in their argument before you explain why you hold different ideas. Be respectful, not condescending. Speak to them in terms of what they care about.</p>
<p>I try to live by the phrase that we’re only allowed to complain about something if we’re doing something to fix it. That said, here’s the three guiding rules towards anything you feel compelled to complain about right now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept Responsibility: if you have the means to influence the world, you have an obligation to make it better, for yourself and for those who are not able to.</li>
<li>Take Initiative: never assume someone else will take care of a problem if you can take the first step in solving it now.</li>
<li>Stay Committed: understand that you will face exhaustion and resistance, but change will only happen if you commit to it and change tact when necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can’t appreciate comfort if we don’t know struggle. Well versed in adversity, Abraham Lincoln once remarked that the United States is a perpetual story of “a rebirth of freedom.” It is not merely the inheritance of greatness from our founders, but something we must earn, time and time again.</p>
<p>So be more than a consumer. Be a citizen.</p>
