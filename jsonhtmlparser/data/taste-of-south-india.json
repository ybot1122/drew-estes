For those unfamiliar with Airbnb/Couchsurfing/Workaway, these are companies that match guests with hosts in different ways. Airbnb works like a hotel, only you stay in someone's extra room or extra apartment for a cost. Couchsurfing is similar, only it's free, the arrangements a bit less glamorous, and you typically have more interaction with your host (which is awesome for getting to know a new city or making friends during your travels). Workaway is somewhere in between the two, where instead of direct payment, you work a certain number of hours per week for a family or small business, and in exchange you get a place to stay. I also plan to stay in more youth hostels, as well as potentially an ashram or Buddhist monastery to see what that's like. (For those who are about to ask, no, I have not seen "

The tricky part when entering another culture is deciding where certain things fall in terms of morality. Arranged marriages for instance, while on the decline in India, are still common, especially in villages and in more traditional families. Even when one of these young men or women has a choice in who they marry, it is often from a small batch of “suitable” partners chosen by their parents, i.e. someone from a good family and in the same caste. As an outsider, this instinctively feels wrong to me. And many Indians agree, hence the decline in the practice. But at the same time, data shows that couples in arranged marriages, while comparatively less happy than those in “love marriages” in the beginning, over time actually learn to appreciate each other more and report "

Using the head wobble as an example, I'll explain this as best i can. It's a side to side wobbling of the head, with the axis of the turn usually centering around the nose. While a similar gesture in the U.S. might indicate uncertainty or resistance (like how you respond to someone asking if you want to have pho for dinner, when you'd rather have a burrito), in India it's a bit more complicated. While I've heard it explained as “sometimes yes, sometimes no, sometimes both, sometimes neither,” I think this joke only gets at the surface of it. Most often I've found it to work as a simple yes, but just as often it simply means “I'm listening” or “I understand what you're asking, but this gesture has nothing to do with whether I can help you or not.” Context is everything when figuring out what someone's response actually means."

If you're a foreigner, as a guest in their country, many Indians will be very accommodating and go out of their way to ensure your comfort and happiness. Waiters will sometimes pull out chairs for me at many sit-down restaurants (or move tables from booths so I can sit more easily), but not for my Indian friends joining me. They will stand attentively nearby to ensure I'm satisfied with my meal, and will jump to help me if I need anything. However, in low-risk situations where the relationship doesn't matter as much (such as simple transactions at shops), they can afford to be more direct, such as denying a request or getting impatient with the language barrier and yelling."

Within cities, I initially took rickshaws everywhere, but now that I've adjusted to the bus system, I've been doing that whenever possible, and occasionally Uber/Ola in major cities, which are somehow cheaper than the tiny rickshaws.

Adding to my ever-growing list of “things I've seen in life that I never thought I would see,” at this museum I saw an elephant fetus in a large container. It was 14 months into development and about the size of a medium-sized dog. The museum also had a great deal of early taxidermy attempts with an amusingly inconsistent labeling system.

Before I even found a place to stay though, I fell in love with the place. I ended up staying in a guest house there for nearly three weeks. Hampi is unique in many ways, and brings a never ending flow of international travelers, even during the off season. Formerly the most populated city in the region, and home to numerous dynasties and empires, it now supports just a few thousand people, if that. Ruins of ancient bridges, aqueducts palaces and temples are scattered across the landscape at nearly every turn. Surrounding the wide expanses of rice fields, cliffs and boulders serve to support an ever growing subculture of rock climbers. Open roads wind along the valleys and rivers in all directions, providing the perfect place to cruise along on a motorbike and enjoy the views. The weather is mild enough to go for long runs in the morning, (with stops along the way of course, to drink from a coconut fresh from the tree), and the guest houses have communal dining areas that serve as the perfect place to lounge around or to meet fellow travelers. I spent my time here doing all these things, as well as writing a fair amount. I met a ton of amazing people from around the world: some were locals or Indian tourists (Manju, Thimma, Mani, Mowgli, Huda, Kitti, and Nikhil) others German, Argentinian, Norwegian, or Australian (shoutouts to Patrice, Melisa, Erik, and Smiley, respectively).

We climbed the steps of the Birla Mandir, a large white marble temple overlooking the city, unlike any I had seen so far. As the sun set, hundreds of eagles circled the sky overhead, some filling the otherwise empty trees beside the temple. The chanting from the priests of the temple soon blended with the Muslim prayer (Maghrib) as it echoed across the city. In the next couple of days, my friend Sahith from UW put me in touch with his friend Rakesh who lives here, who was kind enough to spend an entire day showing me around the city, and introducing me to some of the best tasting food I've had in recent memory. Hyderabad, among all cities I've been to so far, has the most obvious history of alternating Hindu and Muslim rulership. India has been conquered and reconquered by more empires and dynasties than I can count over its immense history, one of the most famous being the religious being the repeated establishment and elimination of Islamic powers from the regions. Now that the country exists in a comparatively peaceful manner, both populations make up significant portions of the city. Muslims live predominantly in an area referred to as Old Hyderabad, where you can walk through the streets and clearly see the architectural influences, as well as the different styles of the people (women in burkas and men in throbes and taqiyahs)."

Often seemingly innocuous at first, it's only a matter of time before you figure out what they're trying to sell you. Today I had three people on the same sidewalk do this in only a few minutes. Each told me I had something in my ear, went to grab it by trying to stick their fingers in my ear and doing what was some attempt at a magic trick. Turns out all three of them (and others on that sidewalk) are amateur street magicians, and each asked for a donation after attempting to violate my ear canal. This wasn't the normal “look it's a coin” trick, but a ball of orange wax whose cleanliness I have serious doubts about."

These guys will often run up, smiling and holding up their phones as they ask to take a selfie. Sometimes they won't ask at all, and will simply come up next to you with a phone out and start posing. As soon as you say yes to one person and “just one selfie,” dozens of their friends come running over to get their own personal photo with you."

I feel like there are an endless number of misunderstandings and incorrect ideas by Westerners about India, so I would be happy to clarify anything to the best of my knowledge. I'm sure I'll look back on this post months from now and reconsider some of the observations I make now, and what they mean, but it's a neverending process of trying to be less wrong."
